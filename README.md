# 23128-Adapter-passive
This is an EPROM adapter for Commodore C16 (C254). It also works as a kernal adapter for the C64 (4x BASIC+Kernal). The better option for the C64 can be found <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/C64-Kernal-Adaptor-Switch-short-board-">here</a>

It allows up to 4 Kernals for the C16, which can be selected by jumpers.
